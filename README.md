# Battery-Discharge-Capacity
This project deals with estimating the discharge capacity of a battery or battery pack based on machine learning models. The model was initally extracted from a research paper and was trained on the pre-existing dataset. A new dataset is recreated mathematically comprising of both derviable and experimental features.
